# Week 0 — Billing and Architecture

## C4 Architecture Models
C4 models (also known as Context, Containers, Components, and Code) is a software architecture model that provides a way to visualize and organize the structure of a software system. It is based on the idea of breaking down a system into four distinct aspects: context, containers, components, and code. The C4 model provides a way to communicate software architecture by providing a common language for describing the structural elements of a system and their relationships.
